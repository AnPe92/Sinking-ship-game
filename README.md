# Sinking-ship-game

Small console Battle ship game made in java,
To play run main. <br />

Things to do: <br />

breakout input validation to its own method. <br />
Implement computer ai, something simple with Math random until valid inputs on placing ships and same for the bombing phase. <br />
Implement score keeping and local db for persistent score keeping. <br />
Look into some library for implementing GUI. <br />
Implement testing (Just started that course at school, so would have been to much time spent on getting all the information on good implemented tests) <br />
